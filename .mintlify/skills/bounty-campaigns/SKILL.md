# Bounty Campaigns

Use campaign commands when the task is about paid campaign performance or campaign metadata.

## Commands

```bash
bounty-cli campaigns list --start-date YYYY-MM-DD --end-date YYYY-MM-DD --json
bounty-cli campaigns list --status active --platform facebook --json
bounty-cli campaigns show <campaignId> --start-date YYYY-MM-DD --end-date YYYY-MM-DD --json
```

## Guidance

- Use `campaigns list` first when you need ids, statuses, platforms, or a quick performance scan.
- Use `campaigns show` once you have the exact campaign id.
- Include date ranges for performance comparisons.
- State the date range and filters used when summarizing results.
