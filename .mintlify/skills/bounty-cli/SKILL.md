# Bounty CLI

Use `bounty-cli` for authenticated marketing operations. The CLI uses the logged-in user's permissions and does not require infrastructure credentials.

## First Checks

```bash
bounty-cli whoami
bounty-cli config get
```

If the user is not logged in:

```bash
bounty-cli login
```

## Workflow

1. Use list commands to discover ids and current state.
2. Use show or analyze commands for detail.
3. Prefer `--json` for analysis, automation, or when another tool will parse the output.
4. Use explicit `--start-date` and `--end-date` values for performance questions.

## Command Map

- Campaigns: `bounty-cli campaigns list`, `bounty-cli campaigns show <campaignId>`
- Ads: `bounty-cli ads list`, `bounty-cli ads show <adId> --platform facebook`
- Creatives: `bounty-cli creatives analytics`, `bounty-cli creatives fatigue <adId>`
- Actions: `bounty-cli actions list`, `bounty-cli actions show <actionId>`
- Agents: `bounty-cli agents list`, `bounty-cli agents show <agentId>`
- Campaign findings: `bounty-cli campaign analyze <campaignId>`
